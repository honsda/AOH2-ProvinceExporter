# AOH2 Province Exporter

I made this program because i had to make it lol and i made it in JavaScript.

This program exports provinces you have made with the Map Editor, so instead of using the Map Editor to export provinces and having to rename the provinces (which isn't the case for Map Editor 2.0) or deleting and remaking the province files with the Map Editor, which is very time consuming. You could use this to export the provinces that are displayed in the Map Editor.

The Instructions of how to use it is in the program.
## Running the program in Windows
1. Download the Zip file from releases.
2. Extract the Zip file.
3. Run it and do what it says.

Also i only made an executable version of the program for Windows, you'll have to download the repository and run it by yourself.

## Running the program for Non-Windows users
1. [Download NodeJS](https://nodejs.org/en/download/) for your OS.
2. Download the repository. (Press "Code" and click "Download ZIP")
3. Extract the Zip file.
4. Open cmd prompt and redirect to the extracted folder using `cd <your-path-here>`.
5. Type `npm install` and wait for it to finish.
6. Run the program by typing `node update.js` on the cmd prompt.
